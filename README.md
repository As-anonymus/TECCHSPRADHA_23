# Custom Chatbot with Voice Assistant

This project is a hackathon submission for building a custom chatbot with voice assistant functionality, and deploying it as a service on any website.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to build a custom chatbot that can interact with users through text and voice commands, and perform various tasks based on user inputs. The chatbot will be integrated with a voice assistant, which will allow users to interact with the chatbot using natural language commands.

The chatbot will be built using Python and various libraries such as NLTK and TensorFlow. The voice assistant will be built using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.

Once the chatbot is built, it will be deployed as a service on GitHub, which will allow users to interact with it through a web interface.

## Features
